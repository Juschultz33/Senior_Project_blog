# Senior_Project

For my senior project I was wanting to look into probability and how it effects the game of Catan. I chose to analize catan because 
Catan has the randomness of dice but has a lot more player input then the game of Risk. I also thought that making simulations of Catan 
would be a great challange and push me but still be do-able in the amount of time given.

So with that background running my catan.py file will run a monte carlo simulation. And with the hope that I will be able to make a app that
allows for more friendly user interaction for when someone is playing the game with firends.
